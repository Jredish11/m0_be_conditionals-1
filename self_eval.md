# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?  I'm feeling a lot better after last night's group session and doing the coding challenges in this assignment.  
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
similar to how i feel on the comparison operators. 

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I feel pretty good about my understanding.  the one thing I had issue on was during the spicy code challenge. I was confused as to why i needed to add certain comparison operators == and and the integer 0 when checking if the value is a multiple of something. I went and asked the question in our slack channel. 

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent about 3 hours total with breaks in between.  I was off about an hour in my initial schedule block for this lesson.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I think more practice with coding challenges like the spicy one.  I need to become more familiar with the methods like % & .  I probably need to add blocks in my calendar to work on coding challenges like these to help get familiar with workflows and fluency of these conditionals.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I don't have any questions on this lesson other than the one I posed for the my slack channel group.  If I can't find the answer I'll first search on google. If I can't find an answer I'll pose a technical question to the slack.
